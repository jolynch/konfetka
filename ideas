This is for jotting down any ideas that would be nice to have

NOTE - these are only IDEAS, probably won't become features any time soon

Joe:
 - Have it so that you can right click the song position slider and add a "bookmark" like
   so if you really like one particular part of a song, just kinda mark it, this would 
   probably take like 5 minutes
     o Allow skipping to cue points

 o Have a tagger, that tags your untagged music either for you, or makes it easy for you 
   to do so
 
 o Make it so that if a song was not found (i.e. status==3), then konfetka will provide the
   option to find the song, and even failing to do that, delete it from the mlib.
 
 - Actually use the bindata api instead of just directly writing to a file in the directory.
